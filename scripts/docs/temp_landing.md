The Shopify SDK for Unity lets you add commerce features to games made with the [Unity](//unity3d.com) game engine. You can use it to connect in-game purchase experiences with physical products in Shopify.

You can use the Shopify SDK for Unity to:

* fetch information about a single product or a collection of products in Shopify
* create an in-game shopping cart where customers can select product options and quantities
* generate a checkout for a single product or an entire cart.

## Getting started
