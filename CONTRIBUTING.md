# How to contribute
We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or
just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/unity-buy-sdk/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
and the [Contributing Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/Shopify/unity-buy-sdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING_DEVELOPER_CERTIFICATE_OF_ORIGIN.txt).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started
To start working on the codebase, first fork the repo, then clone it:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/unity-buy-sdk.git
```
*Note: replace "your-username" with your Github handle*

To check your the project's dependencies run:
```
$ scripts/check_setup.sh
```

## Building the Unity Buy SDK

Before you can start developing on the SDK you'll need to run the code generator. Under the hood, the Unity Buy SDK works on top of GraphQL. In order to query Shopify, we generate a GraphQL client based on the [Storefront API](https://help.shopify.com/api-storefront-api) introspection schema.

To build the GraphQL client, run the following command:
```bash
$ scripts/build.sh
```

Now you are free to write some features.

## Testing

Read our [Testing Guide](TESTING.md)

Add some tests and make your change. Re-run the tests with:

```bash
$ scripts/build.sh
$ scripts/test_unity.sh

# If you made iOS plugin changes
$ scripts/test_ios.sh
```
## Creating your Pull Requests
We use the [beta](https://github.com/shopify/unity-buy-sdk/tree/beta) branch to hold new features and bug fixes before they are seen on [master](https://github.com/Shopify/unity-buy-sdk/tree/master). Please make your pull request to the [beta](https://github.com/shopify/unity-buy-sdk/tree/beta) branch.

## Documentation
If your change affects how people use the project (i.e. adding or changing arguments to a function, adding a new function, 
changing the return value, etc), please ensure the documentation is also updated to reflect this. Documentation is in the `docs/` folder
if further documentation is needed please communicate via Github Issues.
